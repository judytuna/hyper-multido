# hyper-multido

Todo app with multiple "stages" of done-ness. I'm starting with video games.

### todo

 - [x] just to get started: very stupid todo list that is just a bunch of li elements in an unordered list (20 min)
 - [x] how to get html/js into a hyper or ipfs site (1 hr)
 - [x] plan out how to make the parts of the app (1 hr)
 - [x] name the app
 - [x] a list item can be in a different 'stage' (1 hr)
 - [ ] collapse list views into icons in one column
 - [ ] add "time added"
 - [x] save button (40 min)
 - [x] new game field
 - [ ] log every event to see a feed of changes
 - [ ] flip between list with indicator and multiple lists. vertical? horizontal like kanban board?
 - [ ] sorting a unified list (by date? by other things?)
 - [ ] tags on things?
 - [ ] popup should go away if you click outside it
 - [x] autosave per action (1 hr)
 - [ ] add a legend so we know what the colors mean
